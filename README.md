# Patient-controlled electronic health records platform (EHR)

A client-server prototype illustrating prospective DApp operation principles for
self-sovereign medical data. Private/Public key cryptography and encryption-decapsulation
 technologies offer a promising solution to the problems of medical record-keeping 
 systems which are currently centralizsed and insecure.
It's possible to push ownership of health records from centralized service providers to individuals.

Decentralised Patient-Controlled electronic health records (PCEDR) can be buil using
* blockchain with arbitrary code execution capabilities (smart-contracts) like Ethereum
* decentralised global content-addressable storage like swarm/ipfs or/and channels/queues/messengers like plasma/whisper/libp2p transports
* decentralised cryptography-based access-control and key management layer with incentivised reencryption engines.
